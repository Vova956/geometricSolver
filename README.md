GeometricSolver is a mobile application written in Java that implements a Geometry Problem Solver on Android. The app demonstrates geometry logic processing and interactive UI/UX design using the Android SDK and Framework.

📌 Features

🧠 Solves geometry problems programmatically using core logic

📱 Built as a native Android app with Java

🎨 User-friendly interface showcasing geometric computations

📚 Focused on learning and demonstrating geometry logic on mobile

🛠️ Technologies

The project uses the following:

Java — Core application logic

Android SDK & Framework — UI and platform integration

Gradle — Build and dependency management

🚀 Getting Started

To run this application locally:

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Vova956/geometricSolver.git


Open in Android Studio

Open the cloned project in Android Studio

Let the IDE sync and build the project

Run on Device or Emulator

Choose an Android device or emulator

Press Run to install and launch

🧩 Usage

Once the app is running:

Navigate through the UI to access geometry solver tools

Input geometry problems or measurements

The app computes solutions using built-in geometric logic

(You can customize or extend problem types as needed.)
