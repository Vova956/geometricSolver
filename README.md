GeometricSolver is a mobile application written in Java that implements a Geometry Problem Solver on Android. The app demonstrates geometry logic processing and interactive UI/UX design using the Android SDK and Framework.

Features
Solves geometry problems programmatically using core logic
Built as a native Android app with Java
User-friendly interface showcasing geometric computations
Focused on learning and demonstrating geometry logic on mobile
Technologies

The project uses the following:

Java — Core application logic

Android SDK & Framework — UI and platform integration

Gradle — Build and dependency management

Getting Started

To run this application locally:

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Vova956/geometricSolver.git


Open in Android Studio

Open the cloned project in Android Studio

Let the IDE sync and build the project

Run on Device or Emulator

Choose an Android device or emulator

Press Run to install and launch

Usage

Once the app is running:

Navigate through the UI to access geometry solver tools

Input geometry problems or measurements

The app computes solutions using built-in geometric logic

(You can customize or extend problem types as needed.)
